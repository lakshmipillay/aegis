# AEGIS v2 Pro Ultra
Fully wired Gemini + Datadog

Vertex AI Note
AEGIS is designed to run on Gemini via Vertex AI.
At the time of this submission, our Google Cloud billing was still under review, which prevents access to Vertex foundation models.
For the demo and observability validation, we temporarily used Gemini via the Google Generative AI SDK.
Once billing is approved, the code can be switched to Vertex AI by replacing the model backend, with no architecture changes.
